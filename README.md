# 42's Pipex

An introduction to forks, redirections, pipes, and external execution. 
Although some of my peers may disagree, I believe that the point of this
project was not to parse a char bidimensional array, so I have instead
opted to approach it by having a dependency on whereis, thus I have coded
an extra fork which executes whereis to be able to execute the commands
that are inputted by the user. 

This has proven to be a great choice when met with minishell and having
to replicate a much more complex forking/piping work.
